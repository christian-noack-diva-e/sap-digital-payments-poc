= SAP Digital Payment Addon Integration POC
:toc:

== Overview
Project to explore the integration of an ecommerce shop with sap digital payments addon. SAP DPA eases integration of payment with S/4Hana and other systems, having to integrate only one API for all payment providers.

Consists of a vue xref:frontend/README.adoc[**frontend**], making calls to a node xref:backend/README.adoc[**backend**].

participant vue frontend
participant node backend
end

vue frontend ->> node backend: Call e.g. getLib
node backend ->> SAP Digital Payment Addon: /v1/dpjslib/loader
SAP Digital Payment Addon -->> node backend: return 
node backend -->> vue frontend: return
vue frontend ->> SAP Digital Payment Addon: DPJSLIB directly communicates with DPA
SAP Digital Payment Addon -->> vue frontend: return
----

Some calls can only be done from a backend (e.g. getLib). Doing them in the browser will result in cors violation.

=== User Flow

=== Error Handling

==== Invalid Data

Invalid cards are declined directly by the sap dp payment card ui.

=== API Documentation
Since SAP did not yet publish the API documentation, this project includes xref:sapdp_api_doc/README.adoc[**an easy way**]  to view documentation given to us by Patrick Hamp.

=== SAP Commerce Cloud Integration
SAP integrated the Digital Payments Addon also into commerce cloud. That integration is not documented and I did not get it working.

== Architecture Decisions
. Vue was chosen for frontend, because it provides easy & fast development for the poc and is close enough to angular used by the project.
. Node.js was chosen for backend to have the same language for frontend & backend.
